# My First assignment in coding **ever**

I have participated on this cource to get a basic understanding of analyzing data and learn how to use 

- **R**

- **Rstudio**

- **git**

Feeling quite overwhlemed at the moment, since I am a *complete beginner* but **I will not give up, not yet!**
My assignments on this cource are saved and can be found in my Github repository [here](https://github.com/InkaLuotamo/IODS-project.git)
